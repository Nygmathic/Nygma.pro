      <description>&lt;p&gt;The “natural rights” theory.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;meanwhile, invokes another commonsense premise that most of us instinctively&#xA;hold to be true: that the product of mental labor is by all rights the property of its creator, no less than the&#xA;product of physical labor is the property of its creator&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(or of the person who purchases it from that creator).&#xA;This is what Daniel Webster was referring to when he said, “The American Constitution does not attempt to&#xA;give an inventor a right to their invention, or an author a right to his composition; it recognizes an original,&#xA;pre-existing, inherent right of property in such invention or composition.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
