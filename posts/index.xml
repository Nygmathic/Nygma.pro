      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first post here on hugo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Africa is the world&amp;rsquo;s second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth&amp;rsquo;s land area and 6% of its total surface area.[9] With nearly 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world&amp;rsquo;s human population. Africa&amp;rsquo;s population is the youngest among all the continents;[10][11] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[12] Based on 2024 projections.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Africa&amp;rsquo;s population will exceed 3.8 billion people by 2100.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;[13] Africa is the least wealthy inhabited continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate,[14] corruption,[14] colonialism, the Cold War,[15][16] and neocolonialism.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Despite this low concentration of wealth.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;recent economic expansion and a large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and Africa has a large quantity of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The “natural rights” theory.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;meanwhile, invokes another commonsense premise that most of us instinctively&#xA;hold to be true: that the product of mental labor is by all rights the property of its creator, no less than the&#xA;product of physical labor is the property of its creator&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(or of the person who purchases it from that creator).&#xA;This is what Daniel Webster was referring to when he said, “The American Constitution does not attempt to&#xA;give an inventor a right to their invention, or an author a right to his composition; it recognizes an original,&#xA;pre-existing, inherent right of property in such invention or composition.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
