Key Point:Identifying and leveraging market
inefficiencies can lead to substantial investment
gains.
Example:Imagine you spot a tech company&rsquo;s stock
trading below its actual value based on its innovative
products and solid earnings forecast. By researching and
understanding the market dynamics surrounding this
company&rsquo;s potential, you invest early before word
spreads, watching as the stock price rises to reflect its
true worth. This proactive approach, grounded in
