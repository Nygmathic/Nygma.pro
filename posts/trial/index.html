<p>This right is not absolute, of course, and inventors’ inherent rights may at times be circumscribed by national
security or other concerns. But in exchange for disclosing to the public the nature and details of the invention,
the Constitution authorizes the government to enforce the inventor’s exclusive property right to that invention
for a limited time.</p>
