<p>From the earliest days of the United States, patent and legal records show how inventors (including Thomas
Edison) regularly kept abreast of developments in their fields. They did this by studying patent descriptions
published by both the USPTO as well as by industry publications such as Scientific American, which was
founded in 1845 by Munn and Company, the leading patent agency of the nineteenth century, expressly to
spread new technological knowledge and facilitate the buying and selling of patents. For example, Elias E.
Reis—inventor of a number of devices to exploit the heat generated by electrical currents—reported that when
he read in the Official Gazette in 1886 about a patent issued to Elihu Thomson for a new method of electric
welding, “there immediately opened up to my mind a field of new applications to which I saw I could apply my
system of producing heat in large quantities.”vi
In many industries, specialized journals kept readers informed
about new patents of interest.</p>
<p>As with any economic and legal instrument, patents have the potential to slow innovation if their grant of
exclusive rights is too broad. But the overwhelming preponderance of economic research and real-world
experience demonstrate that, on balance, intellectual property rights tend to stimulate invention, economic
growth, and the diffusion of new technological knowledge in every country where they exist.
This fact by itself, however, does not explain why the U.S. patent system became a model for much of the
world. To understand why it did—and how it helped build the most successful economy in the history of the
world—we must examine the revolutionary design of the U.S. patent system itself and the ways in which it
overcame the weaknesses of earlier patent systems.</p>
