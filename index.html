<p>Africa is the world&rsquo;s second-largest and second-most populous continent after Asia. At about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 20% of Earth&rsquo;s land area and 6% of its total surface area.[9] With nearly 1.4 billion people as of 2021, it accounts for about 18% of the world&rsquo;s human population. Africa&rsquo;s population is the youngest among all the continents;[10][11] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[12] Based on 2024 projections.<br>
Africa&rsquo;s population will exceed 3.8 billion people by 2100.<br>
[13] Africa is the least wealthy inhabited continent per capita and second-least wealthy by total wealth, ahead of Oceania.<br>
Scholars have attributed this to different factors including geography, climate,[14] corruption,[14] colonialism, the Cold War,[15][16] and neocolonialism.<br>
Despite this low concentration of wealth.<br>
recent economic expansion and a large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the broader global context.<br>
and Africa has a large quantity of natural resources.</p>

          <p>To help understand why patent rights not only encourage inventors but also promote the wider diffusion of
new technology for the benefit of society, economic historians Naomi Lamoreaux and the late Kenneth
Sokoloff suggested the following thought experiment:
Imagine a world in which there was no patent system to guarantee inventors property rights to their
discoveries. In such a world, inventors would have every incentive to be secretive and to guard jealously their
discoveries from competitors [because those discoveries] could, of course, be copied with impunity. “By
contrast, in a world where property rights in invention were protected, the situation would be very different.
Inventors would now feel free to promote their discoveries as widely as possible so as to maximize returns
either from commercializing their ideas themselves or from [licensing] rights to the idea to others. The
protections offered by the patent system would thus be an important stimulus to the exchange of
technological information in and of themselves. Moreover, it is likely that the cross -fertilization that resulted
from these information flows would be a potent stimulus to technological change.</p>
